      "THAT, aware that, the Export Processing Zones (EPZ) Authority in Kenya was established in 1990 to promote and facilitate export-oriented investment programmes and create incentives for export-oriented production in areas designated as export processing zones; further aware that, the Authority is charged with the responsibility of regulating and administering approved activities within the export processing zones to ensure compliance among others; noting that, the programme anchors on Kenya’s Vision 2030, the country’s Economic Blueprint with regard to becoming an industrialized and upper middle- income country; further noting that, EPZ provides an attractive investment opportunity for export-oriented business ventures in the country; acknowledging that, the programme is a source of direct and indirect employment to more than 60,000 Kenyans; concerned that, currently, the programme is facing a myriad of challenges including inadequate funding, prohibitive cost of accessing business loans, high cost of production, shrinking export market due to effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, inadequate supplies of raw materials, and others, leading to a decline in export-oriented businesses in the export processing zones; further concerned that, there is need to revamp the said programme to improve its performance through increased funding to aid for instance in setting up of Excellence Centres in some parts of the county, expediting on negotiations for market access especially to the East Africa Community (EAC) including trade negotiations between Kenya and other countries on diversification of products eligible under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), employee training and retention, provision of reliable supply of raw materials for Agro-processing companies, improvement of infrastructure to enhance steady supply of water and power and provision of affordable access to credit facilities among others; this House resolves that the National Government through the Ministry of Trade, Investments and Industry, develops a policy whose core objective would be to among others address the challenges currently faced by the EPZ with specific focus on implementing EPZ programmes to enhance performance and enable retention of investors across the country to enhance economic sustainability and allow companies to pursue businesses locally through the 20% waiver to enable them to earn a living.",
